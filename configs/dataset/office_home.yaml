# Office-Home Dataset
# =============================================================================
# Brief: Domain adaptation benchmark with 4 visually distinct domains.
#        Each domain contains 65 object categories from office/home environments.
#
# Labels: 65 classes (office/home objects like Alarm_Clock, Backpack, etc.)
# Scale: ~15,500 images total (~4K per domain)
# Domains: Art, Clipart, Product, Real_World
#
# Use Case:
#   - "Specialist vs. Generalist" gap testing
#   - Edge model (domain-specialized) outperforms on target domain
#   - Cloud model (general zero-shot) struggles with domain-specific styles
#   - Tests domain shift robustness
