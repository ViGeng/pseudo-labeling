# Stylized-ImageNet (SIN)
# =============================================================================
# Brief: ImageNet images with style transfer applied using AdaIN, creating
#        texture-shape conflict. Original texture is replaced with random
#        painting textures while preserving global shape structure.
#
# Labels: 1000 classes (same as ImageNet-1K)
# Scale: ~1.2M images (full ImageNet training set stylized)
# Domain: Natural images with artistic style transfer
#
# Use Case:
#   - "Texture vs. Shape" bias testing
#   - CNNs (texture-biased) fail on stylized images where texture is misleading
#   - ViTs (shape-biased) maintain accuracy due to global shape preservation
#   - Reveals model reliance on texture shortcuts
