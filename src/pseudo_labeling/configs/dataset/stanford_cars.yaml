# Stanford Cars Dataset
# =============================================================================
# Brief: Fine-grained classification dataset of car models. Contains images
#        of 196 car makes/models with annotations for bounding boxes.
#        Challenging due to subtle inter-class differences.
#
# Labels: 196 classes (car makes/models/years, e.g., "Audi R8 Coupe 2012")
# Scale: ~16,185 images (8,144 train + 8,041 test)
# Domain: Natural car photographs from various angles
#
# Use Case:
#   - "Resolution & Crop" inversion testing
#   - Edge model with high-res crop sees distinctive features (headlights, grilles)
#   - Cloud model with full image resized loses fine details
#   - Tests fine-grained recognition capability
