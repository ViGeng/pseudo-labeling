# ResNet-101
# =============================================================================
# Brief: Deep Residual Network with 101 layers. Standard backbone for many
#        vision tasks. Larger capacity than ResNet-18/50, commonly used
#        as a strong baseline in research.
#
# Architecture:
#   - Residual blocks with skip connections
#   - 101 layers (3-4-23-3 block configuration)
#   - Parameters: ~44.5M
#   - FLOPs: ~7.8B
#
# Input: 224x224 RGB images
# Output: 1000 classes (ImageNet-1K)
#
# Bias Profile: Texture-biased (CNN)
#   - Deep convolutional architecture
#   - Relies on local texture patterns
#   - Strong when seeing full context, weak on cropped details
#
# Use Case (Cloud Model):
#   - "Resolution & Crop" experiments (full image resized)
#   - Cloud model processing full image at lower fidelity
#   - Sees context but loses fine-grained details
#   - Edge model with high-res crop can outperform on detail-dependent classes
#
